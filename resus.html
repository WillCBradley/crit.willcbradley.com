        <h2 class="subheading" id="whatisresus">| What is Resuscitation?</h2>
        <p>Resuscitation is the act of restoring core, life-sustaining processes in a person who is dead or dying.</p>
        <p>Even more fundamentally, each of these processes can be traced back to a single molecule:</p>
        <br>    

        <h2 class="subheading" id="oxygen">| Oxygen</h2>
        <p>If <a href="./foundations#homeostasis">homeostasis</a> is the basis of life, energy is the currency of homeostasis.</p>
        <p>When we eat, our bodies take in macromolecules, break them into their smallest repeating units, and — through a network of <a href="./pharm#enzymes">enzyme-mediated</a> reactions — produce so-called coenzymes.</p>
        <p>These coenzymes act as electron donors, creating a charge gradient. The resultant potential energy is converted into chemical energy, where it drives the processes that keep us alive.</p>
        <p>But this electrochemical gradient depends on oxygen.</p>
        <p>And unfortunately, there isn't always enough of it to go around.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h2 class="subheading" id="supplyanddemand">| Supply and Demand</h2>
        <p>Oxygenation is a process, not an event.</p>
        <p>It's a balance between oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen delivery (DO<sub>2</sub>).</p>
        <p>When consumption exceeds supply, we call the resultant state "hypoxia". And if hypoxia is severe enough, it can cause permanent organ damage within minutes.</p>
        <p>Some strategies to address this include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Oxygen (to increase <a href="./foundations#vitals">O<sub>2</sub> sats</a>)</li>
            <li>Fluid resuscitation (to help blood reach tissues)</li>
            <li>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation/CPR (to manually oxygenate and circulate blood)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are many others, but no matter the approach, we can use endpoints to measure effectiveness.</p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="subheading" id="endpoints">| Endpoints</h2>
        <p>When resuscitation works, the body returns to “normal”.</p>
        <p>As part of this normality, certain downstream factors also return to their regular ranges.</p>
        <p>So, by measuring these downstream factors (known as “endpoints”), we can get an idea of whether a patient has stabilised.</p>
        <p>Some common endpoints are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Heart rate</li>
        <li>Blood pressure</li>
        <li>Urine output (proxy for renal perfusion/function)</li>
        <li>Serum lactate (marker of anaerobic metabolism)</li>
        <li>Base deficit (indicative of respiratory/<a href="./renal#ph">renal pH control</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No single endpoint is conclusive, but they combine to form a clinical picture.</p>
        <p>Next, let’s take a look at <a href="./underconstruction">respiratory physiology</a> in more detail.</p>
