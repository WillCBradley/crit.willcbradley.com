        <h2 class="subheading" id="enzymes">| Enzymes</h2>
        <p>Chemical reactions require energy.</p>
        <p>Even exothermic reactions (like explosions) need an initial nudge before they can begin.</p>
        <p>We call this nudge the "activation energy" of a reaction; the higher a reaction's activation energy, the more work required to get things started.</p>
        <p>This is where enyzmes come in.</p>
        <p>Their specialised protein structures bind to certain reaction ingredients ("reactants"), decreasing activation energy.</p>
        <p>In turn, lower activation energy facilitates chemical reactions that keep us alive.</p>
        <p>Plus, they play an important role when it comes to medications:</p>

        <br>    

        <h2 class="subheading" id="pk">| Pharmacokinetics (PK)</h2>
        <p>PK is often described as "what the body does to a drug".</p>
        <p>Its four main pillars are absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.</p>
        <p>Let's quickly go through each.</p>
        <br>

        <p><u>Absorption</u></p>
        <p>Absorption is the active or passive movement of a drug into the bloodstream after it's been administered.</p>
        <p>It depends on properties of the drug (e.g. size, charge, lipid solubility), and of the body (e.g. GI surface area for oral drugs, or tissue perfusion for IM injections).</p>
        <p>But even once a drug reaches the blood, it might not stay there:</p>
        <br>

        <p><u>Distribution</u></p>
        <p>Distribution describes the movement of a drug between the blood and other tissues.</p>
        <p>This can be quantified as volume of distribution (V<sub>D</sub>); higher V<sub>D</sub> means more ready distribution into tissues, and hence a higher dose required for any given plasma concentration.</p>
        <p>Distribution is variable based on many factors, including body composition (e.g. relative volumes of fat vs fluid), and drug properties (e.g. relative <i>solubility</i> of the drug in fat vs fluid).</p>
        <p>Regardless, most drugs meet the same fate.</p>

        <br>

        <p><u>Metabolism</u></p>
        <p>Metabolism is when the body chemically alters drugs, often into forms that can be excreted.</p>
        <p>It primarily occurs in the liver across two main phases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Phase I (Functionalisation) — The addition of small groups of atoms ("functional groups") to the chemical structure of a drug in preparation for Phase II.</li>
            <li>Phase II (Conjugation) — The linking of functionalised drug molecules to a other endogenous molecules, typically making it more water soluble.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The resultant molecules ("metabolites") can be active (meaning they exert some kind of pharmacological effect), inactive (mean they don't), or even toxic (where they can cause direct harm).</p>
        <p>But in any case, we eventually move on to the final step:</p>
        <br>

        <p><u>Excretion</u></p>
        <p>Excretion is the process by which the body gets rid of drugs.</p>
        <p>It tends to occur in the liver (through bile) and the <a href="./renal">kidneys</a> (through urine), but drugs can also be excreted through breath, sweat, saliva or breast milk.</p>
        <p>Two drug properties are relevant here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clearance (Cl) — Volume of blood plasma cleared of drug per unit time</li>
            <li>Half Life (t<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>) — Time taken for active drug concentration to reduce by 50%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But we're getting ahead of ourselves.</p>
        <p>Before excretion, drugs need to exert their effects. Let's explore this in more detail.</p>
        <br>

        <br>
        
        <h2 class="subheading" id="pd">| Pharmacodynamics (PD)</h2>
        <p>In contrast to PK, PD describes "what a drug does to the body".</p>
        <p>Obviously, this a broad topic, but there are key principles we can refer back to:</p>
        <br>
        
        <p><u>Receptor Theory</u></p>
        <p>Cells are complex.</p>
        <p>At any given moment, they can be undergoing huge, cascading chains of chemical reactions.</p>
        <p>Which begs the question: how do drugs exert their desired effect amidst all this chaos?</p>
        <p>This is where receptor theory comes in.</p>
        <p>It states that drugs bind to specific, structurally-compatible cell components ("receptors"), forming a receptor-drug complex that initiates downstream biological effects. </p>
        <p>The attraction ("affinity") of different drugs to different receptors, as can the "specificity" with which they bind to any given site (as opposed to all other sites).</p>
        <p>And once bound, they can exert various effects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Agonists — These drugs exert downstream effects</li>
            <li>Antagonists — These drugs exert no effect, and prevent agonists from binding</li>
            <li>Modulators — These change receptor-agonist affinity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But these changes aren't binary. Even once a drug binds to a receptor, many other factors determine the exact effect produced.</p>
        <br>

        <p><u>Concentration-Effect Relationships</u></p>
        <p>This does what it says on the tin: describes the relationship between drug concentration and exerted effect.</p>
        <p>The greater the effect per unit concentration the higher a drugs "potency". And the higher the <i>maximum</i> effect, the greater its "efficacy".</p>
        <p>Based on concentration-effect relationships, we can produce a "dose-response curve".</p>
        <p>And within this curve, a "therapeutic window" can be defined; this is the set of concentrations thought to balance the risk of adverse effects with the potential for therapeutic benefit.</p>
        <p>Which brings us to dosing.</p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="subheading" id="dosing">| Dosing</h2>
        <p>Let's consider two kinds of dosing: loading and maintenance.</p>
        <p>Loading doses are designed to reach a certain concentration, and maintenance doses are designed to keep us there.</p>
        <p>We can calculate these doses as follows:</p>
        <p>Loading Dose = (C<sub>desired</sub> x V<sub>D</sub>) / Bioavailability</p>
        <p>Maintenance Dose = C<sub>desired</sub> x Cl x Time</p>
        <p>These should intuitively make sense. If they don't, I haven't done my job well enough, so please re-read <a href="./pharm#pk">this</a> and (if still stuck) feel free to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:will@willcbradley.com">email me</a>.</p>
