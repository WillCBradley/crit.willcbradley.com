        <h2 class="subheading" id="infection">| Infection</h2>
        <p>Biology plays rough.</p>
        <p>For billions of years, organisms have competed over finite resources for survival.</p>
        <p>And sometimes, they resort to hostile takeover.</p>
        <p>Infection occurs when disease-causing micro-organisms (pathogens) invade our bodies, multiplying and causing damage.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to avoid this, our immune systems are engaged in a never-ending arms race with these pathogens, each continually trying to outsmart the other.</p>
        <p>Along the way, we developed all kinds of weapons, like the lymphatic system, memory cells, and antibodies.</p>
        <p>But that doesn't stop us from leaning on one of the oldest tricks in the book:</p>

        <br>    

        <h2 class="subheading" id="inflammation">| Inflammation</h2>
        <p>Immunity is expensive.</p>
        <p>Rather than personalising a response for every tiny insult, our bodies have an initial, generalised response to deal with percieved threats.</p>
        <p>One aspect of this response is inflammation.</p>
        <p>Inflammation involves recruitment of immune cells and dilation of nearby blood vessels. Its five features are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Redness</li>
            <li>Swelling</li>
            <li>Heat</li>
            <li>Pain</li>
            <li>Loss of Function</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All in all, this is designed to remove pathogens, clear cellular debris, and promote healing.</p>
        <p>But sometimes, things get out of hand:</p>

        <br>
        
        <h2 class="subheading" id="sepsis">| Sepsis</h2>
        <p>Sepsis occurs when the body's normal immune response spirals out of control.</p>
        <p>Rather than the usual, self-limiting process, we see a systemic inflammatory response, leading to massive vasodilation all throughout the body.</p>
        <p>This rapidly drops <a href="./haem#coreparameters">SVR</a>, <a href="./haem#heartfunction">preload</a>, <a href="./haem#coreparameters">CO</a>, and thus <a href="./haem#coreparameters">MAP</a>, leading to a kind of <a href="./haem#shock">distributive shock</a> known as "septic shock".</p>
        <p>But unfortuntately, that's not all.</p>
        <p>As part of its inflammatory response, sepsis can also cause body-wide abnormal blood clotting ("sepsis-induced coagulopathy").</p>
        <p>Here, the body forms tiny blood clots ("microthrombi") that can impede blood flow, while also consuming platelets that would otherwise be used to prevent harmful bleeding.</p>
        <p>The net effect of all this? Reduced delivery of blood to vital organs (including the <a href="./neuro#perfusion"></a>brain), and increased risk of death.</p>
        <p>As you might imagine, this all requires prompt intervention.</p>
        <p>And a core pillar of this intervention is <a href="./pharm">pharmacological management</a>.</p>
