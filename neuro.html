        <h2 class="subheading" id="icp">| Intracranial Pressure</h2>
        <p>The brain is encased in bone.</p>
        <p>With the exception of a few foramina, the cranium can almost be thought of as a static container — that is, it doesn't flex to accomodate the volume of its contents.</p>
        <p>You can see how this might cause problems.</p>
        <p>If we looked inside your skull right now, we'd find different volumes of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, and brain tissue.</p>
        <p>Each of these exert outward force, like air in a balloon. We call this force "intracranial pressure" (ICP).</p>
        <p>Which leads us to the Monroe-Kelly doctrine.</p>
        <p>According to this doctrine, the volume of brain, blood, and CSF in the skull is roughly stable. If one increases, others must decrease.</p>
        <p>This lets us <a href="./foundations#decompensation">compensate</a> for changes in ICP, but only up to a certain threshold. After all, blood volume is finite, and we need a certain amount to survive.</p>
        <p>Speaking of which:</p>
        <br>    

        <h2 class="subheading" id="perfusion">| Perfusing The Brain</h2>
        <p>Getting blood to the brain is hard.</p>
        <p>Not only are we (usually) pumping against gravity, we also have to overcome ICP.</p>
        <p>In practice, this means <a href="./haem#coreparameters">MAP</a> must exceed ICP for cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) to be moving in the right direction. Said another way:</p>
        <p>CPP = MAP - ICP</p>
        <p>Without positive CPP, we cannot survive.</p>
        <p>In this context, it's easy to see how haemodynamic changes can have such profound and rapid effects.</p>
        <p>If MAP falls too low or ICP climbs too high, the brain doesn't get enough blood. And it's not a huge leap from cerebral hypoperfusion to brain damage.</p>
        <p>Then, from brain damage, it's an even smaller leap to get to cerebral oedema.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h2 class="subheading" id="oedema">| Cerebral Oedema</h2>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, fluids are fluid.</p>
        <p>Under ordinary circumstances, this fluid stays where it belongs, like inside blood vessels or cells.</p>
        <p>But when things go wrong, it can escape.</p>
        <p>Abnormal fluid accumulation is known as oedema — in the brain specifically, we call it <i>cerebral</i> oedema.</p>
        <p>There are two main types of cerebral oedema:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vasogenic — caused by disruptions in the blood brain barrier (such as infection, malignancy, or trauma)</li>
            <li>Cytotoxic — caused by energy dysfunction at the cellular level (such as from ischaemia or certain toxins)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note: cerebral oedema is not the sole cause of raised ICP.</p>
        <p>But it works well to illustrate the concepts of oedema (which can occur in many different parts of the body), and raised ICP (which can occur in many different pathologies).</p>
        <p>Plus, it ties in nicely with our <a href="./renal">next topic.</a></p>
