        <h2 class="subheading" id="ph">| pH</h2>
        <p>Hydrogen is everywhere.</p>
        <p>It's in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the stars that fill our galaxy.</p>
        <p>But not all molecules treat hydrogen the same way.</p> 
        <p>While some happily soak up hydrogen ions (bases), others are keen to palm them off at the earliest opportunity (acids).</p>
        <p>This balance is measured by pH (power of hydrogen) — a logarithmic sliding scale between 1 (meaning very acidic) and 14 (meaning very basic).</p>
        <p>If blood pH moves outside the normal range of 7.35-7.45, we risk disrupting the chemical reactions and structures that sustain life.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, the renal and <a href="./resp">respiratory</a> systems play an important role in stabilising the body's overall  pH:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The lungs monitor CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the blood, modulating its conversion into carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>).</li>
            <li>The kidneys monitor levels of acidic hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) and basic bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) in the blood and urine.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But there's another important factor that influences pH (and many other functions).</p>

        <br>    

        <h2 class="subheading" id="electrolytes">| Electrolytes</h2>
        <p>Electrolytes are substances that ionise in water, producing electroconductive solutions.</p>
        <p>They play several roles in the body:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Regulating pH — We now understand what this means in more depth. pH is a crucial aspect of <a href="./foundations#homeostasis">homeostasis</a>.</li>
            <li>Fluid balance — Movement of electrolytes creates osmotic gradients that pull fluid across semi-permeable membranes, helping it to stay where it should be.</li>
            <li>Nerve and muscle function — Including voluntary movement, cardiac function, sensation, and cognitive processes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each time blood passes through the kidneys, electrolytes are pulled between the urine and vasculature through various ion channels.</p>
        <p>The net effect, in a functioning kidney, is to retain/excrete the right amounts of the right electrolytes, ensuring that all upstream factors keep functioning as they should.</p>
        <p>Let's explore these mechanisms in more detail.</p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="subheading" id="transport">| Membrane Transport</h2>

        <p>Concentration describes the quantitify of a substance per unit volume of a solution.</p>
        <p>As with <a href="./resp#ventilation">pressure gradients</a>, substances tend to move from areas of high to low concentration.</p>
        <p>Which leads us to the different kinds of membrane transport:</p>
        <br>

        <p><u>Passive Transport</u></p>
        <p>This type of transport occurs along concentration gradients.</p>
        <p>We call the passive transport of water "osmosis". In most other instances, it's referred to as "diffusion".</p>
        <p>"Facilitated diffusion" is like regular diffusion, but uses certain membrane proteins to allow substances through. Some of these proteins ("ion channels") only allow specific ions to pass.</p>
        <p>As the name implies, passive transport requires no energy.</p>
        <p>But things aren't always this easy.</p>
        <br>

        <p><u>Active Transport</u></p>
        <p>Active transport occurs <i>against</i> concentration gradients.</p>
        <p>To do this, cells use stored <a href="./resus#oxygen">chemical energy</a> from a molecule known as ATP ("primary active transport"), or ride the coat-tails of nearby ATP expenditure ("secondary active transport").</p>
        <p>This is useful, but fragile.</p>
        <p>When there's enough energy, active transport helps keep us alive. But when if plug is pulled, things can go sideway:</p>


        <br>
        
        <h2 class="subheading" id="aki">| Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)</h2>
        <p>An AKI is a sudden, significant decrease in kidney function.</p>
        <p>There are three types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prerenal — <a href="./haem">Insufficient blood flow</a> to the kidneys.</li>
            <li>Intrarenal — Reduced function of the kidney itself, such as due to toxins, adverse drug effects, or <a href="./haem#ischaemia">ischaemia</a>.</li>
            <li>Post-renal — Caused by pressure buildup distal to the kidneys, such as in the ureters, bladder, or urethra.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can imagine how, in an untreated AKI, the regulation of pH and electrolytes could become life-threateningly dysregulated.</p>
        <p>Especially when it occurs as a complication of another pathology, such as <a href="./sepsis">sepsis</a>.</p>
