        <h2 class="subheading" id="ph">| pH</h2>
        <p>Hydrogen is everywhere.</p>
        <p>It's in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the stars that fill our galaxy.</p>
        <p>But not all molecules treat hydrogen the same way.</p> 
        <p>While some happily soak up hydrogen ions (bases), others are keen to palm them off at the earliest opportunity (acids).</p>
        <p>This balance is measured by pH (power of hydrogen) — a logarithmic sliding scale between 1 (meaning very acidic) and 14 (meaning very basic).</p>
        <p>The renal and <a href="./resp">respiratory</a> systems play an important role in stabilising the body's overall  pH:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The lungs monitor CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the blood, modulating its conversion in carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>).</li>
            <li>The kidneys monitor levels of acidic hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) and basic bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) in the blood and urine</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But there's another important factor that influences pH (and many other functions).</p>

        <br>    

        <h2 class="subheading" id="electrolytes">| Electrolytes</h2>
        <p>Electrolytes are substances that ionise in water, producing electroconductive solutions.</p>
        <p>They play several roles in the body:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Regulating pH — We now understand what this means in more depth. pH is a crucial aspect of <a href="./foundations#homeostasis">homeostasis</a>.</li>
            <li>Fluid balance — Movement of electrolytes creates osmotic gradients that pull fluid across semi-permeable membranes, helping fluid to stay where it should be.</li>
            <li>Nerve and muscle function — Including voluntary movement, cardiac function, sensation, and cognitive processes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each time blood passes through the kidneys, electrolytes are pulled between the urine and vasculature through various ion channels.</p>
        <p>The net effect, in a functioning kidney, is to retain/excrete the right amounts of the right electrolytes, ensuring that all upstream factors keep functioning as they should.</p>
        <p>But sometimes, the system can break down:</p>
        <br>
        
        <h2 class="subheading" id="aki">| Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)</h2>
        <p>An AKI is a sudden, significant decrease in kidney function.</p>
        <p>There are three types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prerenal — <a href="./haem">Insufficient blood flow</a> to the kidneys.</li>
            <li>Intrarenal — Reduced function of the kidney itself, such as due to toxins, adverse drug effects, or <a href="./haem#ischaemia">ischaemia</a>.</li>
            <li>Post-renal — Caused by pressure buildup distal to the kidneys, such as in the ureters, bladder, or ureter.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can imagine how, in an untreated AKI, the regulation of pH and electrolytes could become life-threateningly dysregulated.</p>
        <p>Especially when it occurs as a complication of another pathology, such as <a href="./sepsis">sepsis</a>.</p>
